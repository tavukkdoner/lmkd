Total GPU includes:\nprivate allocations by GPU driver (alloc_pages/kmalloc/etc)\ndmabufs exported by GPU driver\n\nSo there is an overlap between dmabuf heaps and GPU (some dmabufs from dmabuf heaps are also included in total GPU).\nHowever there is no overlap between GPU total and dmabuf heap pools because pools contain only buffers which are currently unused.

      "message": "I\u0027m likely wrong about kmallocs from GPU driver. Need to double check with Yiwei. I think only large allocations are traced and included in BPF map. I doubt GPU would use kmalloc for large allocations.\n\nRemoving duplication between GPU dmabuf mapped buffers and the same buffers in dmabuf heaps is non-trivial task as I mentioned before and involves dmabuf sysfs traversal and access to memtrack HAL, so unfortunately I don\u0027t think LMKD can afford to do that.",
