Here, lmkd main thread is just producer and always asking the killing to reaper, consumer thread. It would need list management but not hard with just single lock and then we will have more consistent handling with simple code. If we really need to handle parallel termination of processes, we could just create one more thread in reap.c, which is scalable and simple.",
